<h1>Learning Tracker App</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Learning Tracker</strong> app is a productivity tool designed to help users track their daily learning habits, maintain consistent learning streaks, and provide flexibility through “frozen days” that allow for occasional breaks without breaking the streak. Built with <strong>SwiftUI</strong>, the app combines a clean, interactive design with features that encourage regular engagement and goal setting.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

    <li><strong>Onboarding Setup:</strong> Set your personal learning goals and preferences right from the start, ensuring a tailored experience that aligns with your objectives.</li>
    <li><strong>Daily Tracking:</strong> Easily log your learning activities every day to track progress and build streaks. Visual feedback on your streaks keeps you motivated to stay consistent.</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar View:</strong> View your progress over time with the monthly calendar view, offering a clear visual representation of your achievements and learning trends at a glance.</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze Day:</strong> Life happens – use a “Freeze Day” when needed to pause without breaking your streak, giving you the flexibility to stay on track even on busy days.</li>
